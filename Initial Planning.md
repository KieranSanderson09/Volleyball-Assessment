Title: Slammer customers to spike

Mission/Goal: 
The objective of the website is to promote Slammers and increase customers at Slammers by at least 50%. However, since most customers are aged 35-50, the client wishes for the website to be suited to appeal to the younger audience (15-30) and get them more actively involved at Slammers.

Success Evaluation:
As Slammer has stated they have about 100 customers at the moment, we can establish that the website is intended to bring that level to 150 customers. We can evaluate the success of the website through observing customer increase at Slammers, by using company records to see the quantified data and determining if the website is achieving the mission. 

Target Audience: 
The website is intended to appeal to the younger audience as Slammer would like to increase customers of the age between 15-30.
